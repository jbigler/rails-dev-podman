# Nothing persists: `off` puts it all back.
#
# The docker version served the rails and rustfs containers by their bridge IPs,
# because tailscaled runs on the host and could route straight into a docker
# bridge. Rootless podman cannot do that: its netavark bridge lives in a
# separate network namespace, and podman-unshare(1) says connecting to a
# rootless container by IP "is otherwise not possible from the host network
# namespace". A tailscale sidecar per worktree would be one answer; the far
# simpler one is that loopback-published ports ARE reachable from the host, and
# `tailscale serve` takes a plain http://127.0.0.1:<port> target. So rails@ and
# rustfs@ publish :3000 and :9000 on per-worktree loopback ports and this points
# tailscale at those.
#
# Traefik stays bypassed, exactly as before: no Host-header rules are involved
# and no other worktree becomes reachable.
