# Serves the rails and rustfs containers by their docker IPs — tailscaled runs
# on the host and routes to the bridge networks directly, so this needs no
# published ports. Traefik is bypassed, which sidesteps its Host-header rules
# and keeps every other worktree unreachable.
#
# The overrides go in a compose file, not .env.development: compose.yml already
# sets DOMAIN and RUSTFS_ENDPOINT as container env, and dotenv never overwrites
# an ENV var that is already set.
