# Print the Playwright version pinned by a Rails Gemfile.lock.
#
# playwright-ruby-client tracks upstream Playwright releases, so its locked
# version drives the browser-server image tag and the npm playwright-core
# version (see Dockerfile.playwright). Best-effort: prints nothing (exit 0)
# when the lock or the gem is missing, so units-env.sh can fall back to its
# default tag.
#
# Usage: playwright-version.sh [path-to-Gemfile.lock]   (default: Gemfile.lock)

# The dependency line ("      playwright-ruby-client (>= 1.16.0)") is indented deeper.
