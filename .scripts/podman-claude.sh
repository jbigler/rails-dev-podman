# Run Claude Code for this worktree in a one-off interactive container.
#
# Deliberately NOT a systemd unit. Under compose this was `docker compose run
# --rm claude` against a service carrying profiles: ["do_not_start"] -- a
# foreground, interactive, throwaway container. A Quadlet unit models a service:
# systemd starts it detached with nothing attached to its TTY, so `systemctl
# --user start claude@<wt>` could never give you a session. claude@.container
# was removed for that reason and its mount set lives here instead.
#
# The unit's Wants= is reproduced by starting rails and playwright first. The
# test path is claude -> playwright -> rails: Claude drives the browser server,
# and the browser visits the rails dev server by its `rails` network alias. So
# starting claude alone has to bring both up, or its system tests have nothing
# to drive and nothing to visit. Failures there are not fatal -- neither should
# take the Claude session down with it.
