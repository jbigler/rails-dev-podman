# this path, which lands inside the bind-mounted home. Under docker the daemon
# created the missing file root-owned, which then broke the user-level
# `rm -rf .home/<slug>` in wt:rm. Rootless podman would create it as you, so
# that specific hazard is gone; creating it here keeps the home's contents
# predictable rather than depending on what the runtime does with a missing
