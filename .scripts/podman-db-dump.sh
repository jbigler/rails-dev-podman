# db@'s initdb hook (restore-dump.sh) creates and restores <dbname>.dump on a
# first start against an empty data volume, and rustfs-init@ untars
# rustfs_data.tar.gz when /data/rustfs0 is absent. So a dump taken here is
# picked up automatically by the next `up` on an empty volume.

# Usage: podman-db-dump.sh [clear]
