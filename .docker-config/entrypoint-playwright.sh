# ".localhost" resolves to 127.0.0.1/::1 inside the browser, before the system
# resolver runs — so this service's extra_hosts entries pointing those names at
# Traefik are invisible to it, and e.g. a presigned RustFS URL on
# http://s3.<worktree>.localhost/ fails with ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED. curl does
# the same; Ruby and Node honour /etc/hosts. Rather than fight each client,
# make the browser's own answer correct: forward loopback :80 to Traefik, which
# routes on the Host header exactly as it does for the host browser.
